# BLUESCREEN PINK â™¥

The club control interface.

Makes heavy use of [React](https://github.com/facebook/react).

Redox was removed in favor of react hooks.


Plays nicely together with camelidae.
Also see: [Alpaca](https://github.com/cameliot/alpaca) (Go) and 
[Llama](https://github.com/cameliot/llama) (Python).
